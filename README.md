## Simulator of cultural evolution

This simulation environment models the process of cultural assimilation with
asymmetric evolutionary strategies. There are two population of agents, they are 
mortal, they can breed, and they exchange messages with every one in close range.
Agents have `culture` attribute, which represents their ---- to certain population.

 - First strategy is to have more children per individual (fertility factor).
 - Second is to have the ability to assimilate more efficiently (assimilation factor).
